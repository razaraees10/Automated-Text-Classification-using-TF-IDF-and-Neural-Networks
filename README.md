# Automated-Text-Classification-using-TF-IDF-and-Neural-Networks
Implemented a text classification system utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and
neural network architecture to automatically categorize text documents into
predefined labels. The project involved preprocessing textual data, transforming
it into TF-IDF feature vectors, and training a neural network model for
classification.
The model achieved robust performance in accurately categorizing documents,
enabling efficient organization and retrieval of textual information.
